This group project is a store front for the spooky items all good trick or treaters. 
They will have a page where the customers will look at the items and view them in more detail.
We will be focusing on the inventory side of it with an Admin registration and login. The Admin will be able to 
create new inventory, update what is in stock and other components of the items. They will also be able to delete the item from
inventory entirely. Which is full CRUD.
We will also be adding bootstraps as our bonus. 
If time permits we would like to try a item category list.

Our group name and store name will be Nightmare Nook.
